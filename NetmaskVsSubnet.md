The terms **netmask** and **subnet mask** are often used interchangeably in networking, but they have subtle differences in context.

### Netmask
- **Definition**: A **netmask** is a 32-bit binary mask used to divide an IP address into its network and host portions. It specifies which part of the IP address identifies the network and which part identifies individual devices (hosts) within that network.
- **Usage**: The term "netmask" can refer to any mask used to describe a network's IP range, regardless of whether it's a default network or a subnet.
- **Example**: In IPv4 addressing, a netmask of `255.0.0.0` (or `/8`) would indicate that the first 8 bits are for the network, while the remaining bits are for hosts.

### Subnet Mask
- **Definition**: A **subnet mask** is a specific type of netmask used when a larger network is divided into smaller subnetworks (or subnets). It defines the division between the network portion and the subnet/host portion within a network.
- **Usage**: Subnet masks are commonly used in the context of subdividing an IP network into smaller, manageable subnets. The concept is especially useful in complex networks to organize IP address space, control traffic, and enhance security.
- **Example**: In a `/24` subnet mask, written as `255.255.255.0`, the first 24 bits represent the network and subnet portion, while the last 8 bits are for hosts. This means the IP address space can support up to 256 addresses, with 254 usable for hosts.

### Key Differences
1. **Context**: 
   - **Netmask** refers broadly to any mask for identifying network/host boundaries.
   - **Subnet Mask** specifically refers to a mask used to define subnets within a larger network.

2. **Scope**: 
   - **Netmask** is often used in general terms for the primary network identifier.
   - **Subnet Mask** is used to define a smaller network segment within a larger network.

### Example in Practice
If you have a network `192.168.0.0` with a default netmask of `255.255.0.0`, this netmask indicates that `192.168.x.x` belongs to the same network. To create subnets, you could apply a subnet mask like `255.255.255.0` to break it into smaller segments, with each subnet supporting up to 254 hosts.

### In Summary
While the terms are closely related, **"netmask"** can apply generally to any network boundary mask, whereas **"subnet mask"** specifically indicates a mask used to divide a network into subnets.
